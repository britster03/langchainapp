        #now for these chunks we whave to create embeddings
        #first understand what is embedding? - embedding is a process of creating vectors using deep learning. an embedding is the output of this process -- in other words, the vector that is created by a DL model for the purpose of similarity searches by that model.
        #now what are embeddings? - in simple words embeddings are numerical representations of information, such as text, images, documents and audio. they represent each character as vector representation
        # Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data that capture the meaning and relationships of words, phrases, and other data types.
        # The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness, and large distances suggest low relatedness. 
        # In natural language processing (NLP), a word embedding is a representation of a word. The embedding is used in text analysis. The representation is a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word. Words that are closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. 
        #vector embedding that we will be using will take each chunk and we will use openai embeddings for that
        
        #embeddings

        
        #langchain supports a lot of vector stores
        #One of the most common ways to store and search over unstructured data is to embed it and store the resulting embedding vectors, and then at query time to embed the unstructured query and retrieve the embedding vectors that are 'most similar' to the embedded query. 
        #A vector store takes care of storing embedded data and performing vector search for you.
        
        #here we will use the FAISS vector database
        #here we have to pass chunks(documents) along with embeddings

        store_name = pdf.name[:-4] #took the file name and dropped the last 4 letters that are corresponding to .pdf and then we can pass this on store_name
        st.write(f"{store_name}")
        embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
        VectorStore = FAISS.from_texts(chunks, embedding=embeddings)
        # st.write(text)
        

        # we will use a text input to take query from the user
        query = st.text_input("Ask questions about your PDF file:")
        # st.write(query)
        ## till now we created a knowledge base by using the files and the embeddings generated from it
        ## then we are able to accept questions from the user as well
        ## now we need to compute embeddings based on the search and do a semantic search
        ## when we do a semantic search the result is going to be a bunch of documents which the system thinks is similar to our query
        ## now this is the operation which we want to perform our knowledge base / vector store and not LLM
        if query:
            docs = VectorStore.similarity_search(query=query, k=3) # here we find the similar docs , 
            #'k' is the max number of documents you want to return, this is very important when we are dealing with LLM
            # this is where the concept of context window comes in because the above step returns us the most relevant documents 
            # then you take these most relevant documents and feed them through the LLMs so that becomes the context for the LLMs
            # and finally along with the query and above context the LLM tries to generate the response
            
            # so now we have got the documents that are most relevant to the question asked by the user and these will be passed to the LLM
            # we are using the openai LLM
            # and we will be feeding the questions as well as the context to the LLM and for this purpose we are using the chains from LangChain
